## Your challenge

This repository is the starter template for the **Voice Command API** project.

The frontend is already built. It records up to **20 seconds** of audio in the browser, sends that audio to your backend, and shows:

- the transcription returned by the API
- the final task response returned by the API

Your job is to implement the backend so the full voice-to-action flow works end to end.

---

## How the project works

The frontend uses a single public entry point:

- `POST /transcribe`

That endpoint must:

1. receive recorded audio from the frontend
2. transcribe it to text
3. reuse the same routing logic as `POST /instruction`
4. execute the corresponding task action in memory
5. return the transcription, the instruction payload, and the final result

Your backend must also expose:

- `POST /instruction`
- `GET /tasks`
- `POST /tasks`
- `PUT /tasks/{task_id}`
- `PATCH /tasks/{task_id}`
- `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}`

Important:

- Use **in-memory storage only**. No database and no files.
- The frontend is provided and should not be modified as part of the exercise.
- The backend included in this repository is only a template. You must implement the missing logic.

## How to start

You can open this project in [GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/4GeeksAcademy/voice-command-api) or clone it locally.

If you use Codespaces, the repository already includes a `.devcontainer` prepared for Python, Node, FastAPI, and Vite.

### Option A: GitHub Codespaces

1. Open the repository in Codespaces.
2. Wait for the dev container to finish installing dependencies.
3. Create `.env` from `.env.example`.
4. Create `frontend/.env` from `frontend/.env.example`.
5. Run the backend and frontend from the terminal tabs.

### Option B: Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/voice-command-api
cd voice-command-api
```

Create your own repository and update the remote:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY
```

### Backend setup

Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and fill in your Groq credentials.

Install dependencies and run the API:

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend setup

Create `frontend/.env` from `frontend/.env.example`.

Run the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What you need to build

### 1. Task storage in memory

- Create a module-level `tasks` list
- Each task must include `id`, `title`, and `done`
- IDs must be unique and increment correctly

### 2. Task endpoints

- `GET /tasks` returns the full list
- `POST /tasks` creates a task
- `PUT /tasks/{task_id}` replaces a task
- `PATCH /tasks/{task_id}` partially updates a task
- `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}` removes a task

### 3. Instruction endpoint

Implement `POST /instruction` so it:

- receives `{ "transcription": "..." }`
- calls the Groq API
- returns only a JSON object with this shape:

```json
{
  "endpoint": "/tasks",
  "method": "POST",
  "params": { "title": "Buy groceries" }
}
```

Do not hardcode intent matching with manual rules such as `if "add" in text`.

### 4. Transcription endpoint

Implement `POST /transcribe` so it:

- accepts `multipart/form-data` with an audio file
- transcribes the audio
- calls the same instruction-routing logic used by `/instruction`
- executes the selected task action
- returns:

```json
{
  "transcription": "add buy groceries to my list",
  "instruction": {
    "endpoint": "/tasks",
    "method": "POST",
    "params": {
      "title": "Buy groceries"
    }
  },
  "result": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Buy groceries",
    "done": false
  }
}
```

## Debugging tip

If the transcription shown in the frontend is already wrong, the problem is in the audio capture or speech-to-text step.

If the transcription is correct but the action is wrong, the problem is in `/instruction`.
